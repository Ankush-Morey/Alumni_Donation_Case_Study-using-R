# Alumni_Donation_Case_Study-using-R
Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If administrators could determine the factors that influence increases in the percentage of alumni who make a donation, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased revenues. Research shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with teachers are more likely to graduate. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn might lead to increases in the percentage of alumni who make a donation. The dataset contains data for 48 national universities (Americaâ€™s Best Colleges, Year 2000 Edition).

I have performed linear regression and advanced statistical methods for variable selection and model optimization.
